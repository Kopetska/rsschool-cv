**###About myself ** 


  I have been working as shift manager in a restaurant business for 11 years. During this time I have made a career from an employee to a shift manager. I am responsible for the staff management, the food preparation and the customer service during the shift. I have gained a lot of valuable experience in team communication and time management.
  I have been thinking of changing my career direction. I am keen on programming. Thatâ€™s why I took a course in Front-end Development last year. And I keep learning now. Development interests me because it provides ample opportunities for professional growth.
I am quick learner, self-motivated and persistent.
I think the combination of my education, skills and experience could be a good addition to become a Front-end Developer.
